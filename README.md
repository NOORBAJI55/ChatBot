# Gemini Pro Chatbot

This project implements a simple command-line chatbot using the Google Gemini Pro generative model. The chatbot allows users to engage in interactive conversations by sending messages and receiving AI-generated responses.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface
- Utilizes Google Generative AI's Gemini Pro model
- Easy to use with Python

## How It Works

The script retrieves an API key for Google Generative AI and configures the Gemini Pro model. Users can input messages, and the chatbot responds in real-time until the user decides to exit the conversation.

This project is ideal for those interested in exploring AI-driven chat applications and natural language processing.
